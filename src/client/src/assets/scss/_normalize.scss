/**
 * 1. Prevent padding and border from affecting element width.
 *
 *    We used to set this in the html element and inherit from
 *    the parent element for everything else. This caused issues
 *    in shadow-dom-enhanced elements like <details> where the content
 *    is wrapped by a div with box-sizing set to `content-box`.

 *
 * 2. Allow adding a border to an element by just adding a border-width.
 *
 *    By default, the way the browser specifies that an element should have no
 *    border is by setting it's border-style to `none` in the user-agent
 *    stylesheet.
 *
 *    In order to easily add borders to elements by just setting the `border-width`
 *    property, we change the default border-style for all elements to `solid`, and
 *    use border-width to hide them instead. This way our `border` utilities only
 *    need to set the `border-width` property instead of the entire `border`
 *    shorthand, making our border utilities much more straightforward to compose.
